# The Higgs Boson Challenge
Authors : ABOUELOULA Ayman , QUIROZ FERNANDEZ Javiera
## Code architecture:

implementations.py: contains the 6 functions to be implemented, as well as other useful functions like build_poly.

validation.py : contains the cross validation functions that we used to deduce the hyperparameters

helpers.py: contains the functions necessary for data cleaning as well as other useful functions to upload the data and make predictions

run.py:produces exactly the same .csv predictions which we used in our best submission

run_function_name.py: produces .csv file using the function "function_name"

## Instructions:
1-you must first download the data and put it in the same file as the source code

2-the code can be run by ./run.py from a terminal

3- The submission csv file can be found in the same "res.csv"
